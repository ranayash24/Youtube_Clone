/**
 * Utility class for calculating readability scores for text content.
 * This class provides methods to calculate various readability scores
 * based on the content of a text, with a primary focus on the Flesch-Kincaid
 * Grade Level. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is a readability test designed
 * to indicate the complexity of English text based on sentence length, word
 * length, and syllable count.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class includes the following functionality:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Calculating the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level for a given text.</li>
 *   <li>Supporting methods for counting words, sentences, and syllables.</li>
 *   <li>Handling non-English or empty content by returning a default score.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 *     String content = "This is a sample text.";
 *     double gradeLevel = ReadabilityScoreUtil.calculateFleschKincaidGradeLevel(content);
 *     System.out.println("Grade Level: " + gradeLevel);
 * </pre>
